# The Purpose
This project is meant to serve as a data engineering project using some of the
relevant tools found in industry. For now it is something simple, however, as
time progresses, I will try and expand on this project as much as I can with the
limited time I have with my thesis

# What is the project?
This project makes use of the spotify API to extract various data from my
personal listenings. As I said, this will start of simply as is, with future
plans to implement further and incorporate other things as I see fit. For now,
this extracts spotify data, and stores the necessary items in a postgres
database running in a docker container. 

From there I can add the necessary transformations to data that I choose to.
